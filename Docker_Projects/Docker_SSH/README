What is this project?
This project teaches you how to:
Create two Ubuntu containers using Docker
Configure one as an SSH Server (Container 1)
Configure the other as an SSH Client (Container 2)
Establish a secure SSH connection from container 2 to container 1
| Step                                     | Action                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Pull Ubuntu image**                 | Get the latest Ubuntu image from Docker Hub                       |
| **2. Run Container 1**                   | Start the first Ubuntu container                                  |
| **3. Install SSH Server in Container 1** | `apt install openssh-server` to allow SSH access                  |
| **4. Set root password in Container 1**  | Use `passwd` command so SSH login is allowed                      |
| **5. Run Container 2**                   | Start the second Ubuntu container                                 |
| **6. Install SSH Client in Container 2** | `apt install openssh-client` to make outbound SSH connections     |
| **7. Use SSH in Container 2**            | Run: `ssh root@<Container1-IP>` to connect to the first container |
| **8. Test secure connection**            | Ensure the containers can talk to each other securely using SSH   |
